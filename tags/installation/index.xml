The config files that ship with Congo contain all of the possible settings that the theme recognises. By default, many of these are commented out but you can simply uncomment them to activate or change a specific feature.
A few things you need to set for a new installation:
# config/_default/config.toml baseURL = &amp;#34;https://your_domain.com&amp;#34; languageCode = &amp;#34;en-AU&amp;#34; title = &amp;#34;My awesome website&amp;#34; It&amp;rsquo;s also useful to set the author configuration in the config/_default/author.</description></item></channel></rss>
