Congo is a highly customisable theme and uses some of the latest Hugo features to simplify how it is configured.

The theme ships with a default configuration that gets you up and running with a basic blog or static website.

> Configuration files bundled with the theme are provided in TOML format as this is the default Hugo syntax. Feel free to convert your config to YAML or JSON if you wish.

The default theme configuration is documented in each file so you can freely adjust the settings to meet your needs.

{{< alert >}}
As outlined in the [installation instructions](/docs/installation/#set-up-your-configuration-files), you should adjust your theme configuration by modifying the files in the `config/_default/` folder of your Hugo project and delete the `config.toml` file in your project root.

## Parameters

Congo provides a large number of configuration parameters that control how the theme functions. The table below outlines every available parameter in the `config/_default/params.toml` file.

Many of the article defaults here can be overridden on a per article basis by specifying it in the front matter. Refer to the [Front Matter](/docs/front-matter/) section for further details.
