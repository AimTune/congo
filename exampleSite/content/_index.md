{{< lead >}}
A simple, lightweight theme for Hugo built with Tailwind CSS.
{{< /lead >}}

This is a demo site built entirely using Congo. It also contains a complete set of [theme documentation](/docs/). Congo is flexible and is great for both static page-based content (like this demo) or a traditional blog with a feed of recent posts.

Explore the [sample pages](/samples/) to get a feel for what Congo can do. If you like what you see, check out the project on [Github](https://github.com/jpanther/Congo) or read the [Installation guide](/docs/installation/) to get started.
